# Diversity & Inclusion (HR) Dashboard (Power BI)

## 1. Project Overview & Goal
This project focuses on creating a comprehensive Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) dashboard using Power BI. The main objective is to visualize key D&I metrics within an HR context, allowing organizations to track their progress, identify areas for improvement, and foster a more inclusive workplace culture.

## 2. Data Source
The data for this D&I dashboard is likely an HR dataset containing employee demographics (e.g., gender, age, ethnicity, disability status), department, job role, and possibly performance or compensation data.

## 3. Tools and Technologies Used
* **Microsoft Power BI Desktop:** For data connection, transformation (Power Query), data modeling (DAX), and dashboard creation.

## 4. Key Analysis and Insights
* **Demographic Breakdown:** Visualizing the distribution of employees across different demographic categories (gender, age groups, ethnicity, etc.).
* **Representation by Level/Department:** Analyzing D&I metrics across various organizational levels, departments, or job functions to identify disparities.
* **Gender Pay Gap Analysis (Optional):** If data permits, visualizing salary differences based on gender and other demographics.
* **Recruitment Diversity:** Tracking diversity in new hires compared to the overall workforce.
* **Retention Analysis:** Examining retention rates across different demographic groups.
* **Trends Over Time:** Observing changes in D&I metrics over specific periods.

## 5. Dashboard / Visualization Features
* **Key D&I Metrics:** Displaying overall diversity percentages, representation rates, and other relevant KPIs.
* **Interactive Slicers:** Allowing users to filter data by department, job role, region, or specific demographic attributes.
* **Visual Breakdown:** Utilizing various chart types (bar charts, pie charts, stacked columns, treemaps) to present demographic distributions clearly.
* **Comparison Views:** Enabling comparison of D&I metrics between different groups or time periods.

## 6. Project Structure & Files
* `Diversity_Inclusion_HR.pbix`: The main Power BI Desktop file, containing the data model, transformations, and the complete dashboard.
